# Squared

This project contains **Squared** - Python programs for perfecting programming 
skills.

In order to practice and work on both my programming and mathemetical skills, 
I've set up this project to give an overview of the problems I've worked on so 
far. Some are in Jupyter (IPython) notebooks, some in `.py` files. You can view 
the files here, or clone the project. The style of this overview is inspired by
and based on [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes).
